Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Kanti Bot uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Discord.js] - Discord.js is a powerful node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API very easily.
* [EJS] - EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.


And of course the Bot itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

You can either invite the Bot [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=505160600100405248&scope=bot&permissions=8). Or run the Bot on your computer!
Kanti Bot requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the Bot.

```sh
$ cd PUBLIC-KantiBot
$ npm install
$ nodemon bot.js
```
